# scraper

Still a work-in-progress. This is currently intended to be mainly for proof-of-concept.
Only internships per company can be scraped at the moment. 

## Setup

Install everything in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To run, use `python scraper/internships.py [COMPANY]`. 
Replace [COMPANY] with the actual name of the company you want to scrape.
